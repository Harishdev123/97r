<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <mark>
			printing and typesetting industry.</mark>
			Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard <i>dummy text</i> ever since the 1500s,
 <br/>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <strong>scrambled</strong> it to make a type specimen book.
				It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
						 electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br/>It was <del>popularised in the 1960s</del> with the <ins>release of Letraset</ins> <u>sheets containing</u> Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <small>versions</small> of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
